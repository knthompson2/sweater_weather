## Project Background
[SweaterWeather](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/projects/sweater_weather/) is a 5 day, solo project, during Mod 3 of 4 in Turing School of Sofware and Development's Back-End program. 

The goal was to build a fully functional JSON API-compliant REST API that aggregates data from several third-party API endpoints that require authentication, and renders responses back to authenticated users who would make requests from a separate (non-existent) front-end application framework. 

The learning goals include:

- Exposing an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- Exposing an API that requires an authentication token
- Exposing an API for CRUD functionality
- Determining completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
- Researching, selecting, and consuming an API based on your needs as a developer

The project requirements can be found [here](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/projects/sweater_weather/requirements).
